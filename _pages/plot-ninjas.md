So... what are Plot Ninjas?

Well, it’s no joke trying to write a 50,000 word novel within a span of thirty days; at some point during the month, a Wrimo will definitely lose some steam. Don’t worry, it’s perfectly normal, especially for an activity as huge as this one, it can be very daunting to finish 1,667 words every day, especially when your characters don’t seem to be talking to each other, or when you just can’t find the words, or when you’re seriously behind your word count. But don’t fret. That’s why we have plot ninjas.

Plot Ninjas are these little... well, plot ideas that you can use to up your wordcount. They can be relevant to your story or they could be not. They’re small, undeveloped ideas that is often left to the writer to be interpreted and added into the novel.

Here in Pinoywrimos, we want you to win, to reach 50,000 words at the end of November (or even earlier). Which is why there is the plot ninja box — the small box at found there at the left side which gives you a random plot idea whenever you need it. Use one or all –  it doesn’t matter. If it works for your story and if it makes you meet your word count, then that’s what matters. :) Don’t like the idea that is there? Well, just click Refresh or hit F5 on your keyboard and a new one will pop out. You may also see the list of plot ninjas here.

This list is manually maintained, so if you have any plot ideas that you might want to share, leave a comment at this entry or drop us a line and we’ll have it added to the list. :)

Short on inspiration? Here’s something to help you out. :) 

Plot: A college student finds a book full of empty pages. They start to write a story. But everything that happens in that story starts happening for real.

Tell the story of a mistake made in the kitchen.

“I lie awake at night thinking that marrying her was the wrong decision.”

“I’ll always be your sister. But I can’t be your friend anymore.”

"Sugar cookies are fine! You guys are freaks!"

“How do you know so much about her? Are you going to run off with her and live in the woods? Maybe the four of you can live in a cave together. You and your crazy sister can live like animals with your half-human, chicken-stealing lovers and wear sticks in your hair.”

"Woohoo! Road trip!"

"So wait, you got tazed? Individually, or all together?"

The ability to read minds turned out to be quite different than I imagined.

Have one of your own character write a NaNo that exactly mirrors your own novel.

"Whoops."

It was one of those mornings when I really wished I hadn't quit drinking.

Have your character go to a party with complete strangers.

Introduce a character that talks incessantly, even asking questions, but never allowing time for anyone to provide an answer.

Main Character is forced to take responsiblity of someone else's child for a period of time

Tell a legend of the country or place the characters are travelling through, with or without actual relevance to the story or the situation the characters are currently in.

The characters go club-hopping.

Give one of the characters a dark and twisted family secret that comes out.

You know that homeless guy/night porter/hotdog merchant that your MC rudely ignored in chapter 3? Well he nicked from her pocket and now, racked with guilt, follows your MC through the book trying to return it without her noticing.

Have a character read to other characters from a story book of some kind.

Make one of the really minor characters fall in love with your MC and send them little gifts, culminating in them professing their love for him/her/it and getting totally rejected.

Introduce some minor characters who don't really take part in the main plot, but watch major events happen and comment on them from the sidelines.

Introduce characters that speak a different language or dialect than your main character.
